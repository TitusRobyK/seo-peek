# SEO Peek Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-10-29_

## Overview

SEO Peek is a browser extension maintained by Titus Roby K. The extension inspects
the DOM of the page you are viewing so you can review on-page SEO signals without
opening Developer Tools. It never transmits data to external services.

## Data Collection

We do **not** collect or store any user data in any of the categories listed in
the Chrome Web Store disclosure form, including personally identifiable
information, financial or authentication data, browsing history, user activity,
or page content.

## Local Storage

The extension stores only your display preferences (e.g., hide/show certain
sections) using `chrome.storage.sync`. These settings remain on your device and
sync across Chrome profiles signed into the same Google account.

## Data Handling Certification

We certify that:

- We do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, apart from the approved use cases.
- We do not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to the extensionâ€™s single purpose.
- We do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.
